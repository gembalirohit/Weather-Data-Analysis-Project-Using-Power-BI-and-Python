# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## 📊 Overview
This project presents a **comprehensive Power BI dashboard** built to analyze weather data trends.  
The dataset underwent multiple stages of **data preparation**, cleaning, and transformation before being visualized interactively.

---

## 🧠 Objective
To perform **data-driven weather analysis** using Power BI by:
- Cleaning and transforming raw data.
- Building visual dashboards that highlight key weather insights.
- Enabling dynamic filtering and exploration of climate patterns.

## 🗂️ Files Included
| File Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `weather data analysis powerbi dashboard.pbix` | Power BI dashboard file |
| `Data Preparation.html` | HTML documentation showing the data preparation process (Python / Power Query steps) |

---

## ⚙️ Data Preparation
Data was preprocessed using tools like:
- **Python / Pandas** for initial exploration and cleaning.  
- **Power Query** for shaping data before loading into Power BI.

Key Steps:
1. Removed duplicates and null records.  
2. Standardized date and temperature formats.  
3. Calculated additional metrics such as humidity averages and temperature anomalies.  
4. Integrated cleaned data into Power BI for modeling and visualization.

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- Interactive filters for **Date**, **City**, and **Weather Condition**.
- Dynamic visualizations for:
  - Average Temperature by Month.
  - Rainfall Distribution.
  - Humidity and Wind Speed trends.
  - Comparative analysis between cities.
